There's two people who haven't laughed for four years, so they attended the Funny Gala. <br>
There's three people who haven't laughed for six years, so they all attended the Funny Gala. <br>
The team of two people has already watched for five minutes, but instead of laughing they looked at the team of three people. <br>
The team of three people has already opened their teeth, but haven't laughed yet. They looked back at the team of two people. <br>
We promise, if no one laughs, then tomorrow we will act again. <br>
If at that point, there is still no one laughs, then next year we will rename this to the Sad Gala.
