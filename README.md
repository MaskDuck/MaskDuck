This is really not the place to talk about COVID-19, but since it affect me, and my ability to contribute to open source projects, I have no other choice rather than posting it here.

I just heard that I may got COVID-19, so I must have a rest soon if I eventually have COVID-19. I right now in an very dangerous situation - I have really close interactions with COVID-19 patient. I haven't got a test yet, but I'll update this readme soon as long as I have more thing to share.

Right now, I am going to being less responsive, possible no activity on GitHub. So I won't be able to respond to any issue you open in the project I maintain. Other maintainer(s) will be the one to help you, not me, if the project have 2+ maintainers. If the project have 1 maintainer, you should wait for me to recover, I'll try my best to respond as soon as possible.

If you want to help me, feel free to donate to Vietnam COVID-19 Vaccine Foundation [here](https://quyvacxincovid19.gov.vn/eng).

Thanks for reading this, and hope you understand things I wrote below. I appreciate all the kind words, and every donation Vietnam receive during this pandemic.
